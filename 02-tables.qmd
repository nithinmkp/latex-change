We collect data of household sentiments from Consumer Pyramid Household Survey (CPHS)^[The Consumer Pyramid Household Survey (CPHS) is conducted thrice every year since 2014 by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Under CPHS, a large panel of sample Indian households are surveyed. This large longitudinal dataset is widely acknowledged as representative of the Indian economy. For details see; [https://consumerpyramidsdx.cmie.com/](https://consumerpyramidsdx.cmie.com/)]. It is a large longitudinal data set, representative of Indian economy. CPHS collects data of household sentiments of India since April, 2016. To collect the sentiment data, a generic Indian household h is surveyed thrice in a year, e.g.; a household surveyed in April, 2016 is surveyed again in August, 2016 by CPHS for the collection of the sentiments data and so on. To assess the sentiments, CPHS asks questions about the present conditions as well as the future expectations of the household financial position, and the business condition. In the process, to assess the present conditions, CPHS asks the following 2 questions to the households - (I) Compared to a year ago, how is your family faring financially these days?; and (II) Do you think that this is generally a good or bad times to buy things like furniture, refrigerator, television, two-wheeler, and car? Along with this, CPHS asks the following 3 questions to assess the short-run and the long-run future expectations of the households - (III) How do you think that a year from now, financially, your family would be faring?; (IV) How would you describe the financial and business conditions in our country in the next 12 months?; and (V) What do you think would be the financial and business conditions in our country in the next 5 years? The answer to questions (I), and (III) are recorded as Better, Same and Worse, and accordingly a numerical value, 1, 0, -1 is assigned. On the other hand, answers to questions (II), (IV) and (V) are recorded as Good time, uncertain time and Bad time, and accordingly a numerical value, 1, 0 and -1 is assigned to the answer. 

Along with sentiments, we also collect data of household's monthly expenditure on 8 major food groups, and fuel & lighting from CPHS from April 2016. The 8 major food groups include - (1) cereals; (2) oils and fats; (3) fruits; (4) pulses and products; and (5) milk and milk products; (6) meat, fish and egg; (7) vegetables and spices; and (8) sweets and snacks. Along with the above mentioned 8 food groups, we also collect data on household expenditure share for food & fuel. We find that the 8 food groups and the fuel and lightning contribute almost 92% of the expenditure for the Indian households. [@tbl-desc]{.content-visible when-format="docx"} [\Cref{tbl-desc}]{.content-visible when-format="pdf"} reports the descriptive statistics of the data collected from CPHS^[The lower panel of [@tbl-desc]{.content-visible when-format="docx"} [\Cref{tbl-desc}]{.content-visible when-format="pdf"} shows the impact of Covid-19 on household sentiments. The significant rise in the proportion of pessimistic households, and the corresponding decline in the proportion of optimistic households as depicted in the lower panel of [@tbl-desc]{.content-visible when-format="docx"} [\Cref{tbl-desc}]{.content-visible when-format="pdf"} shows the negative impact of the Covid-19 on the psyche of Indian households. By using the difference of the optimistic households and the pessimistic households, we calculate the balance statistics to give a graphical representation of the pessimistic impact of Covid-19 on the psyche of Indian households. For details, see  and the discussion in @sec-4.]. Using this data, and by using the methodology described below, we calculate two types of expenditure minimizing consumption bundles for the Indian households – (i) food bundle: consisting of the 8 food groups mentioned above; and (ii) food & fuel bundle: consisting of the fuel & lighting along with the 8 food groups mentioned above.

Along with this, we also collect data on the price index of the aforementioned eight food groups, as well as fuel and lighting, from MoSPI^[See; [mospi.gov.in](https://mospi.gov.in/) for the data of price index.]. MoSPI directly reports the price index for the first five food groups—(1) to (5) listed above. However, it separately provides the price index for the following food items:(i) Meat and fish
(ii) Egg
(iii) Vegetables
(iv) Spices
(v) Sweets
(vi) Snacks. Using the price indices of these food items and their corresponding weights, we calculate the monthly price index for the remaining three food groups:(6) Meat, fish, and eggs
(7) Vegetables and spices
(8) Sweets and snacks
